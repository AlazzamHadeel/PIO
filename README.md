# Feature Selection using Pigeon Inspired Optimizer for Intrusion Detection System

# Abstract
Feature selection plays a vital role in building machine learning models. Irrelevant features in data affect the accuracy of the modeland increase the training time needed to build the model.  Feature selection is an important process to build Intrusion DetectionSystem (IDS). In this paper, a wrapper feature selection algorithm for IDS is proposed.  This algorithm uses the pigeon inspiredoptimizer  to  utilize  the  selection  process.   A  new  method  to  binarize  a  continuous  pigeon  inspired  optimizer  is  proposed  andcompared to the traditional way for binarizing continuous swarm intelligent algorithms.  The proposed algorithm was evaluatedusing three popular datasets:K DDCU P99, NLS-KDD and UNSW-NB15.  The proposed algorithm outperformed several featureselection algorithms from state-of-the-art related works in terms of TPR, FPR, accuracy, and F-score.  Also, the proposed cosinesimilarity method for binarizing the algorithm has a faster convergence than the sigmoid method.
